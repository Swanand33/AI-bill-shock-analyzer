# 🚀 Bill Shock Detector - AI-Powered Anomaly Detection

An AI-driven **Bill Shock Detector** that identifies unusual spending patterns using **Isolation Forests**. This project is designed for **financial analysts, consultants, and businesses** to detect unexpected billing anomalies.

## 📌 Features
✅ **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies bill shocks based on transaction history.  
✅ **Machine Learning**: Uses `IsolationForest` for anomaly detection.  
✅ **Customizable**: Works with any transaction dataset.  
✅ **Efficient & Lightweight**: Trains in seconds, detects anomalies in real time.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Data Processing & Model)
- **scikit-learn** (`IsolationForest` for anomaly detection)
- **pandas** (Data Handling)
- **joblib** (Model Saving & Loading)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Bill-Shock-Detector.git
cd Bill-Shock-Detector

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Prepare Your Data
Add your transaction data to:

data/transactions.csv
📌 Ensure your CSV has an "Amount" column.

4️⃣ Train the Model
Run the following command:

python utils/anomaly_detection.py
✅ This will generate a trained model at: models/anomaly_model.pkl.

5️⃣ Detect Anomalies
Use the function in your script:

import pandas as pd
from utils.anomaly_detection import detect_anomalies

df = pd.read_csv("data/transactions.csv")
anomalies = detect_anomalies(df)
print(anomalies)
📊 Example Output

    ID   Amount  Anomaly
3  104  7500.0  Bill Shock
7  202  9900.0  Bill Shock
